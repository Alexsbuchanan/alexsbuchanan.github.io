	<h1>Hello! My Name Is Alex Buchanan</h1>
        <p>I am a senior at the university of Texas at Austin. I have a very strong interest in programming, and physical systems. My degrees may seem to be non-application based, but my focus is entirely on application! I have experience with Python, Java, C/C++ and Fortran. I also have a heft amount of experience in NIX systems as well and Windows. I also use Arch Linux. </p>
        <h2>Current Project</h2>
	<p>Right now I am currently working on a senior thesis under Professor Matzner in the relativity group at UT Austin. The project aims to simulate the Neutron Binary system detected by LIGO (see Fun Link 2). Such a simulation involves a full general relativity simulation that uses finite differencing. It will also have to do the relativistic hydrodynamics and nuclear physics present during the merger. I am currently in charge of the portion of the code that does the general relativity. We use a set of equations called the General Harmonic Gauge with some modifications from a paper written by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/040711">Frans Pretorius in 2007</a> </p>
